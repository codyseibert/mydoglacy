  h2 Privacy Policy
  
  p This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how Seibert Software Solutions, LLC ("SSS") handles your personal information we collect when you use our services over the Internet, including the MyDogLacy website located at www.mydoglacy.com and affiliated domains controlled by SSS (the “Website”).

  h3 Website Visitors
  p Like most website operators, SSS collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SSS’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SSS’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SSS may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

  h3 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
  p During your interaction with our website, SSS will request personally-identifying information related to you and your animals.  For example, a non-exhaustive list of this information might include information related to you, such as your name and email, or your pets, including you pets name, age, breed, gender, etc.  From time to time, we may analysis and publish statistics created using this information.  Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

  h3 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
  p SSS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SSS’s behalf or to provide services available at SSS, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SSS, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SSS will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, SSS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when SSS believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SSS, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a SSS website and have supplied your email address, SSS may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SSS and our products.  If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SSS takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

  h3 Cookies
  p A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. SSS uses cookies to help SSS identify and track visitors, their usage of SSS, and their website access preferences. SSS visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SSS’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of SSS’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

  h3 Privacy Policy Changes
  p SSS may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in SSS’s sole discretion. SSS encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
